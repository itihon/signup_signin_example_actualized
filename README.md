# Sign-in and sign-up form example

This simple project demonstrates usage of [Isomorphic-validation](https://itihon.github.io/isomorphic-validation/) on the client and server side.

# Usage 

```bash
# build for the client side
pnpm run bundle # or "pnpm run bundle:watch"

# start the server
pnpm run dev

# localhost:8080/signin.html
# localhost:8080/signup.html
```
